# 🧭 Team Portfolio Website Structure & Member Presentation Guide


## Overview
This document outlines how to structure a **team portfolio website** for a 7-member interdisciplinary Capstone team. The goal is to showcase your team’s identity, expertise, and value proposition to potential company partners.

---

## 🧭 1. Hero / Landing Section
**Goal:** Instantly convey who you are and what you’re about.

**Include:**
- Team name and tagline (e.g., “Team SYNAPSE — Innovating Across Disciplines”)
- 1-line description (e.g., “We are a cross-disciplinary team from SUTD combining engineering, design, and computing to solve real-world challenges.”)
- Eye-catching group photo or looping animation
- “Partner With Us” call-to-action button

---

## 💡 2. About the Team
**Goal:** Explain what unites your team and what makes it special.

**Include:**
- Story of how the team formed (e.g., shared vision, complementary skills)
- Mission statement (“We aim to bridge design and technology to create impactful solutions.”)
- Team values or focus areas
- Team logo and color scheme

---

## 👥 3. Meet the Team
**Goal:** Humanize your team; show diversity of expertise.

### Why You Should Include Each Member
1. **Shows Interdisciplinary Strength**  
   Displaying each member highlights the range of expertise (e.g., design, engineering, computing, architecture).

2. **Builds Credibility & Professionalism**  
   Signals transparency and competence — companies can see the skills relevant to their needs.

3. **Humanizes the Team**  
   Personal profiles create trust and make your team more relatable.

### How to Present It
#### Option 1: Team Grid (Recommended)
A responsive grid layout (3-3-1) with consistent cards:

- 📸 Portrait photo  
- 👤 Name  
- 🎓 Faculty (e.g., ISTD / ESD / ASD / EPD)  
- 💬 One-line tagline (“Front-end Developer & UX Researcher”)  
- 🔗 LinkedIn / portfolio icon  

#### Option 2: Skill-Oriented Cards
Each card includes role + skills + contribution:

> **Jane Tan — ISTD**  
> Backend Developer & Cloud Infrastructure Lead  
> Focus: AWS, Python, API design  

#### Option 3: Carousel / Interactive Layout
A dynamic scroll or modal pop-up with photos, bios, and icons.

### Tone & Content Tips
- Keep bios short (2–3 sentences).
- Maintain consistent formatting.
- Use real photos, not avatars.
- Use a professional tone (light personality is fine).

### Bonus
Add a **Team Overview** visualization or skill matrix showing who handles what domain (e.g., “AI & Data,” “UI/UX,” “Hardware”).
